# Simulated-Annealing-for-Projectile-Inclination
A project for an AI course I had.

There is an AI whose goal it is to hit the target with a projectile. The initial velocity of the projectile is a constant.
The user determines the distance of a projectile target and the height and distance of a wall between the initial position and the target position.
The AI uses rudimentary simulated annealing to determine an angle that lands the projectile acceptably close to the target. Although this is something
easily computable, it was neat to demonstrate how simulated annealing can help overcome local minima in the error-space.
